# SDLC Choices

## 1. Incremental Development

### Paragraph to submit:

- **Draft**: <br>We choose Incremental Development as our software development life cycle. Since more assignments about this project are expected to be published, some changes to this project might be required. As a result, we think that need a model that is able to accommodate changes. Incremental development requires multiple versions of projects to be published frequently, so it allows executable products to be generated earlier, and modification can be easily done in later versions. In this way, modification is encouraged and the risk that the product is completely useless is reduced. The restriction of this model is that to rectify a task done in previous version requires modifications in all units and is time-consuming.

<br>

### Organized ideas

#### Reasons

1. **Multiple versions** are required: each assignment can be a version.

2. Operational portion ready **early** in project.

3. The requirements might change and new features might be added as new assignments are published and real user experience with the system is gained. Incremental Model is good at accomodating changes.

4. Restricted schedule (Due Date). Since each iteration of incremental model produces executable products, the model guarantees rapid delivery and deployment which ensure that there is less risk of the product being completely unusable.



#### Why not other: 

- Waterfall: Can't handle the dynamic changing of requirements. (does not suit small project)

- V-shape: Same as waterfall.

- Prototype: Time-consuming.

- Spiral: too many steps for a small project.






## 2. Waterfall Model

- Utilise previous experience: estimation of time, costs and complexity is foreseen.

- Provide more predictable end result for budget, timeline, and scope.

- More complete, polished project in the end: clear structure
